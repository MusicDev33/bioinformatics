## Dev Environment

After you `git clone` the repo, run `npm i` to install all relevant packages.

To start the project in dev mode, run `npm start`. This will start two processes and link the PIDs, one process for handling the SCSS, and another for the JS.

Anytime you edit a file, the correct process will do what it needs to do and then restart.
