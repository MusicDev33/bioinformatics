        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          To get the website on your machine, first find a place you want to put it on your computer, and then run<br>
          <code>git clone git@github.com:MusicDev33/bioinformatics.git</code><br>
          Once you've cloned the repository, go into the 'bioinformatics' folder that was created and type
          <code>npm install</code>. This will install all the NPM packages in that folder.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          To run the website locally, you'll need two terminal windows open, and they both need to be
          in the same bioinformatics folder. In one, run <code>npm run dev-js</code>, and in the other,
          run <code>npm run dev-scss</code>. Now you can open your browser to
          <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
          (or <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">click here</a>)
          and you'll be able to see your changes. Just refresh the page when you make a change. Ctrl+R also refreshes web pages as well.
